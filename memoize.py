class memoize_function(object):
    """Cache the return value of a function

    This class is meant to be used as a decorator of functions. The return
    value from a given function invocation will be cached on the decorated
    function. All arguments passed to a method decorated with memoize must be
    hashable.

    If the argument list is not hashable, the result is returned as usual, but
    the result is not cached.

    This decorator has been adapted from
    http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577452-a-memoize-decorator-for-instance-methods/  # noqa
    and adapted to work on functions instead of methods.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : callable
        Function to memoize.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> @memoize_function
    >>> def types(*args, **kwargs):
    >>>     argtypes = [type(arg) for arg in args]
    >>>     kwargtypes = {key: type(val) for (key, val) in kwargs.items()}
    >>>     return argtypes, kwargtypes
    >>>
    >>> types((1,), key='value')  # result will be cached
    ([tuple], {'key': str})
    >>> types([1], key=set('value'))  # result will not be cached
    ([list], {'key': set})

    """Cache the return value of a method

    This class is meant to be used as a decorator of methods. The return value
    from a given method invocation will be cached on the instance whose method
    was invoked. All arguments passed to a method decorated with memoize must
    be hashable.

    If the argument list is not hashable, the result is returned as usual, but
    the result is not cached.

    If a memoized method is invoked directly on its class the result will not
    be cached.

    This decorator has been adapted from
    http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577452-a-memoize-decorator-for-instance-methods/  # noqa
    with mostly minor aesthetic modifications, plus the support for unhashable
    argument lists and a method for clearing the cahce on an instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : method
        Method to memoize.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> class AddToThree(object):
    >>>     base = 3
    >>>     @memoize_method
    >>>     def add(self, addend):
